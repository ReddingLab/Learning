Histone Purification ProtocolLiv Jensen, 03/2017Adapted from Luger, et al. Updated 03/2018Overview: Express histones in inclusion bodies. Solubilize in GuCl, then dialyze into Urea.  Purify on cation exchange column at room temperature.  Dialyze purified fractions into water and lyophilize.1.	Grow xenopus histones from overnight starter culture in 2XYT at 37ûC.  Induce with 200mM IPTG when OD600 = 0.6; express for 4 hours at 37ûC. (Yield ~50-100mg/L; all buffer volumes given below assume 1L expression culture)2.	Spin down cells (10min @ 4000RPM), remove supernatant, and freeze pellets at -80ûC.3.	Lyse cells:	a.	Resuspend cell pellets in 100ml Buffer A per 1L culture	b.	Sonicate on ice (1s on/ 3 sec off for 10 min at 70% power)	c.	Spin at 20,000g for 15 min.  Remove supernatant and retain pellet Ð protein is expressed in inclusion bodies.4.	Wash inclusion bodies:	a.	Wash pellet with 25ml Buffer B per tube, spin at 20,000g for 15min.	b.	Repeat step 4a for a total of 3 washes with Buffer B.	c.	Wash pellet with 25ml Buffer A per tube, spin at 20,000g for 15min.	d.	Repeat step 4c for a total of 2 washes with Buffer A.5.	Inclusion bodies can be stored at -20ûC at this point.6.	Inclusion body solubilization:	a.	Add 1ml DMSO per oakridge tube, breaking up inclusion body pellet as necessary.	b.	Incubate 30min on nutator at RT.	c.	Add 25ml Buffer C per tube, and incubate with rocking at RT for 4 hr or overnight.7.	Dialyze protein against 3 changes of Buffer D at RT (use 6-8kDa MWCO tubing; histone MW ~11kDa-15kDa).8.	Ion exchange chromatography:	a.	Dilute protein 1:1 with Buffer D, and pass through a 0.2µM syringe-tip filter.	b.	Wash ion exchange column (TOSOH TSKgel SP-5PW, 50ml CV) with Buffer E, then equilibrate with Buffer D.	c.	Load protein onto column at 4 ml/min. Collect flow-through.	d.	Wash column with 1CV Buffer D (or until UV trace returns to baseline).	e.	Elute protein in a linear gradient from 0 Ð 100% Buffer E over 60 min at 4ml/min.9.	Collect and analyze peak fractions by 18% SDS-PAGE.10.	Pool desired fractions and dialyze against water.  11.	Measure protein concentration by A280, and lyophilize in aliquots of useful size.12.	Store lyophilized protein at -80ûC indefinitely.Buffers:A:50mM Tris-HCl pH7.5100mM NaCl1mM EDTA1mM Benzamidine5mM BMEB:Buffer A + 1% Triton X-100C:6M Guanidinium HCl50mM Tris-HCl pH7.55mM BMED:6M Urea (deionized with MB AG 501-X8 (D) Resin from BioRad)20mM Tris-HCl pH7.520mM NaCl5mM BMEE:6M Urea (deionized as above)20mM Tris-HCl pH7.51M NaCl5mM BME
